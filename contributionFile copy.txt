ALPHA CHANGES:
James Foley -  My part I contributed in was player movements, such as a basic lane movement and changes, the crouching, and the crouch back down after jumping. I also added random enemy spawn heights so the player can dodge them in different ways.

Eryk Glowacki - Created all of the scenes, added the main menu + functionality, created the spawn manager + prefabs, created basic functional UI, created the powerups + coins, tweaked the lane system added by james to fit into the set ground, added game over functionality, made spawn rate + speed of the obstacles increase globally 


BETA CHANGES:

James Foley - I did all the audios and background music, added the crouch animation, made it work and look better. Added a cloud prefab for Level 1 and an asteroid prefab for level 2 so it looked like the player was running, added a pause game menu with 4 different options, using a button down the bottom of the levels or the escape key, and I made the lane change smoother movement wise and doesn't hit the edges of the road.

Eryk Glowacki: Made the entire main menu look nice Ex:Added colour change when hovering over button,,new background image + music to main menu, i also added the highscore feature using the Player Prefs, added the running and jumping animations, added the particles behind the character, added the fire behind the rockets in level 1 and the flames coming from the asteroids on level 2, i also made the object destroy itself when it collides with the player and the explosion effect happens when you die, i also added the dying animation and made everything stop when you die
